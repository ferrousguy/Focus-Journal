# [Focus Journal for iOS with UIKit](https://github.com/ferrousguy/Focus-Journal-iOS-SwiftUI)

This repository demonstrates how to integrate the [Adapty SDK](https://adapty.io) into an existing SwiftUI-based iOS project. It contains two branches:

- **`starter`**: A “clean slate” version of the Focus Journal app with no Adapty code included. Use this branch to follow the Quickstart guide and add Adapty yourself.
- **`main`**: The fully integrated version, showing the completed Adapty integration for reference.

## Project Overview

**Focus Journal** is a simple mood journal app that lets users log a daily mood entry and view their history. In the “premium” flow, tapping “History” triggers a paywall if the user is not subscribed. The Adapty SDK is used to:

1. **Activate Adapty at launch**  
2. **Fetch the user’s profile and determine access**  
3. **Display a customizable paywall UI**  
4. **Handle purchase/restore callbacks**  

You can follow along on the `starter` branch to add Adapty manually, or inspect the `main` branch to see the final result.

## Branch Structure

- **`starter`**  
  - Contains the Focus Journal Xcode project without any Adapty code.  
  - Meant as a starting point for readers.  

- **`main`**  
  - Contains the same Focus Journal project, but with all Adapty integration steps already applied.  
  - Compare this branch to `starter` to see exactly which files changed and how.  

---

## Prerequisites

- **Xcode 14.0+**  
- **iOS 15.0+** target (you can adjust as needed)  
- **Swift 5**  
- A valid **Adapty account** with an SDK key (visit [app.adapty.io/settings](https://app.adapty.io/settings) to get your SDK key)  

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ferrousguy/Focus-Journal-iOS-SwiftUI.git
   cd focus-journal
   ```
   
2. **Check out the starter branch**
	```bash
	git checkout starter
	```

3. **Open the Xcode project**
	```bash
	open FocusJournal.xcodeproj
	```

4. **Follow the Quickstart Integration Guide to add Adapty step-by-step.**

5. When you're done, or if you get stuck, switch to the `main` branch to compare your work:
	```bash
	git checkout main
	```
## Running the Example

1.	git checkout main
2.	Open FocusJournal.xcodeproj.
3.	Add your Adapty API key to AppConstants.swift.
4.	Build & run and you’ll see Adapty initialize itself.

Note: You need the products, placements, and paywalls already defined in your Adapty dashboard. See [these docs]() for help.

You should now have a working Adapty integration in a SwiftUI-based iOS app. Feel free to explore the main branch to see the complete implementation or continue customizing the UI in HomeView.swift and ProfileManager.swift.
